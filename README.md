## Data Set Information

This dataset is taken from Kaggle and includes data taken from the NYC Taxi and Limo Commission (TLC). This data includes key information about the date and time a particular ride took place, the number of passengers and the duration of the trip which would be vital to our business goals.

## Problem Statement 

The taxi business is an extremely lucrative one, depending on where it is based, taxis end up being one of the most important modes of transportation. It is especially important for firms in the business to optimize the location at which they have the most availability to ensure they retain the largest number of customers. To this end, understanding taxi demand patterns is crucial for optimizing the allocation of resources. This project uses predictive modeling techniques that consider factors such as time, precise location to determine the ideal conditions to maximize operational availability, and by extension, revenue.
## Model Outcomes or Predictions
This project uses a regression model to predict taxi demand, the model measures number of rides at any given time or location and uses supervised learning to analyze historical trip records and devise potential future demand patterns.
## Data Acquisition
The dataset used for this project is the NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Dataset from Kaggle. The data includes timestamps, pickup and drop off coordinates, trip durations, fare amounts and passenger counts. This provides the necessary critical information to train the requisite predictive models to judge taxi usage patterns.
